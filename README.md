# SEIRD-pandemic-modelling
A SEIRD model has been implemented with an interactive module that allows the user to visualize the various demographic and epidemiological parameters that contribute to the dynamics of a pandemic. The default values represent the numbers associated with the Covid Pandemic.All information regarding the variables associated with modelling the pandemic have been explained in detail in the code.

The first block represents the function where the SEIRD model has been implemented, with the second block calling the function and enabling the widgets. Input the initial population, number of days of pandemic to be simulated and the time steps per day (more time steps for more smoother trends) in the second block and visualize the effects of various parameters on the epidemiology yourselves!
